You want to change how much a running application logs, for example to turn on `DEBUG` output for one package in production while keeping `INFO` for everything else. If the levels are written into Scala code, every change needs a rebuild and a redeploy. ZIO Logging can instead read a root level and a map of logger names to levels from a configuration file, so you change the file and restart the application.

In this guide, we write the levels in a HOCON file (HOCON is a configuration format with braces, unquoted keys, and optional quotes), load the file with `TypesafeConfigProvider` from the `zio-config-typesafe` module, and build a console logger from it. A logger name is the package or class name that a log line came from, and a per-name level applies to every logger whose name starts with that prefix.

The steps are:

1. Understand the filter model in code.
2. Write the levels in a HOCON file.
3. Load the file in the `bootstrap` layer.
4. Check which lines are written.

## Prerequisites

Add the core module and the Typesafe config module to your build:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "dev.zio" %% "zio-logging"            % "@VERSION@",
  "dev.zio" %% "zio-config-typesafe"    % "@VERSION@"
)
```

The examples use these imports:

```scala mdoc:silent
import zio.{ ConfigProvider, ExitCode, LogLevel, Runtime, Scope, ZIO, ZIOAppDefault, ZLayer, ZIOAppArgs, Config }
import zio.config.typesafe.TypesafeConfigProvider
import zio.logging.{ LogFilter, consoleLogger, loggerName }
```

## Understand the Filter Model

The filter is a `LogFilter.LogLevelByNameConfig`, which holds two things: a `rootLevel` that applies when no name matches, and a `mappings` map from a name prefix to a level. The following value sets `INFO` as the root level, and sets `DEBUG` for the payments package and `ERROR` for one noisy client:

```scala mdoc
LogFilter.LogLevelByNameConfig(
  LogLevel.Info,
  "com.example.payments"      -> LogLevel.Debug,
  "com.example.legacy.client" -> LogLevel.Error
)
```

When a log line is written, its logger name is matched against the mapping keys one dot-separated segment at a time, so `com.example.payments` matches `com.example.payments.PaymentService` but not `com.example.paymentsX`. The most specific matching key wins, and if no key matches, the root level applies. The logger name comes from a log annotation if one is set, and otherwise from the location in the code where the log call was made.

## Write the Levels in a Config File

We write the same values in HOCON under the `logger` key. The `filter` block holds the root level and the mappings. The mapping keys are quoted, because a package name contains dots that HOCON would otherwise treat as nesting. The file looks like this:

```hocon
logger {
  filter {
    rootLevel = INFO
    mappings {
      "com.example.payments" = DEBUG
      "com.example.legacy.client" = ERROR
    }
  }
}
```

Level names are the ZIO labels: `ALL`, `FATAL`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `TRACE`, and `OFF`. When `rootLevel` is missing, it defaults to `INFO`. When `mappings` is missing, no per-name level is set. For every key in the console and file configuration, see [Log Filter](./log-filter.md#configuration) and [Console Logger](./console-logger.md).

## Load the Config in the Bootstrap Layer

We pass the HOCON text to `TypesafeConfigProvider.fromHoconString`, and install it with `Runtime.setConfigProvider`. The `consoleLogger()` layer then reads the `logger` key from that provider. The layer's error type is `Config.Error`, so a missing or invalid value is reported as a configuration error when the program starts. The application installs the layer as follows:

```scala mdoc:compile-only
object LevelsFromConfigApp extends ZIOAppDefault {

  val hocon: String =
    """logger {
      |  filter {
      |    rootLevel = INFO
      |    mappings {
      |      "com.example.payments" = DEBUG
      |      "com.example.legacy.client" = ERROR
      |    }
      |  }
      |}
      |""".stripMargin

  override val bootstrap: ZLayer[ZIOAppArgs, Config.Error, Unit] =
    Runtime.removeDefaultLoggers >>>
      Runtime.setConfigProvider(TypesafeConfigProvider.fromHoconString(hocon)) >>>
      consoleLogger()

  override def run: ZIO[Scope, Any, ExitCode] =
    (for {
      _ <- ZIO.logDebug("Charging card") @@ loggerName("com.example.payments")
      _ <- ZIO.logDebug("Cache miss") @@ loggerName("com.example.catalog")
      _ <- ZIO.logInfo("Checkout finished") @@ loggerName("com.example.checkout")
    } yield ExitCode.success)
}
```

The `loggerName` aspect sets the logger name for a block of effects, so this example does not need to live in the package it is testing.

## Check Which Lines Are Written

With the config above, the program writes two lines and drops one:

- `Charging card` is written, because `com.example.payments` maps to `DEBUG`.
- `Cache miss` is dropped, because `com.example.catalog` matches no mapping, so the root level `INFO` applies and `DEBUG` is too low.
- `Checkout finished` is written, because `INFO` meets the root level.

To change the verbosity, edit the HOCON file and restart the application. The `bootstrap` layer runs once at startup, so the new levels take effect on the next start, not while the program runs.

:::warning
The same filter applies to every logger that the console or file logger writes, including logs from SLF4J and `java.util.logging` libraries when they are bridged. The bridges read their level from the `logger.filter` path by default. See [How to Send Java Library Logs Through ZIO Logging](./how-to-bridge-java-logs.md).
